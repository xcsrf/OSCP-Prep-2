###Bash Scripting###

##Goal: Ping Sweep a range##

#ping on a count (-c) of 1; Grep = show only quoted string; #cutting a delimiter (-d) specified in " " - in this case space; #the field specifies the word (in this case the IP address so the #flag yields a curated list of responding IP addresses which is #what we want) of 4. But a range can be specified if 4-9 format is #used; sed is used to remove characters from final output 's/.$//' 
# ***Research pending on the syntax ***

    ping -c 1 192.168.1.1 | grep "64 bytes from" | cut -d " " -f 4 | sed 's/.$//'

#save test results to a file 

    ping -c 1 192.168.1.1 > ping.txt 

#The number of settings is 4 and the interval is 3 seconds:

    ping -c 4 -i 3 www.google.com

#Use the ping command to obtain the IP address of the specified website:

    ping -c 1 google.com | grep from | cut -d " " -f 4

##for loop to do basic scan of the IPs in the list and save to text file

for ip in $(cat iplist.txt); do nmap -Pn $ip; done > nmapresults.txt
